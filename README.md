This is an EdTech web app built using the Phoenix framework. 
I colaborated with an elementary reading teacher in the planning stage of the project.
It was designed to increase her students familarity with common vocabulary words using flashcards and quizzes. 
It also includes gamified elements, like a point-system and a shop.
